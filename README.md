# Chromosomes
Using d3js to sort matches from a spreadsheet into chromosome pairs

chromosome_d3js.html reads a table in a google sheets doc (actually 2, one maternal, one paternal)
The table contains data about DNA matches, and where they fall on each of my parent's chromosome, and how they are related to each other, this data is easily obtained from several DNA companies.
The data is sorted into bars representing positions on the chromosome, then stacked up on either the maternal or paternal side allowing me to see where each section of DNA was inherited back through the generations. The bars are colour coded according to their associated ancestors.
chromosomes_Maternal.html  and chromosomes_Paternal.html are html wrappers to display the visualisation and add a colour menu.
